A small log of me learning Rust :)

# Day 1 2022-02-11 19:21
I started to look at the Rust book today. (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
I got to halfway through chapter 2. So far looking really cool! The functional nature and the standard library seem nice too!
Hope to continue tomorrow, maybe get 2 chapters down? 

Over and out, odeelio.
End log of day 1.
