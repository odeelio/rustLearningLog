A small log of me learning Rust :)

# Day 1 2022-02-11 19:21
I started to look at the Rust book today. (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
I got to halfway through chapter 2. So far looking really cool! The functional nature and the standard library seem nice too!
Hope to continue tomorrow, maybe get 2 chapters down? 

Over and out, odeelio.
End log of day 1. 

# Day 2 2022-02-12 23:58
I got almost to the end of chapter 2, will finish tomorrow and hopefully more chapters as well. 
Very fun so far.

Over and out, odeelio.
End log of day 2.

# Day 3 2022-02-13 22:41
Finished chapter 2, game works exactly as expected. Will continue again tomorrow.

The early bird gets the worm,
The bird who waits gets the best worm.

Over and out, odeelio.
End log of day 3.

# Day 4 2022-02-15 23:04
No more progress made other than reading the start of chapter 3. Though I have something else planned, a blog perhaps.

A bird who flies far has no purpose if its story does not travel far beyond its nest.

Over and out, odeelio.
End log of day 4.
